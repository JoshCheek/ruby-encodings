-----  Default external/internal encodings (UTF8 and nil, despite magic comment and flags)  -----
  external encoding          | #<Encoding:UTF-8>
  internal encoding          | nil

-----  File system says it is iso-8859-1, but reads in as UTF-8  -----
  file system says:          | "iso-8859-1"
  file                       | "\xE7\n" #<Encoding:UTF-8>

-----  It isn't a valid UTF-8 file b/c, you know, it's not UTF-8...  -----
  exception when matching    | #<ArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8>

-----  Forcing the encoding causes gives a hex representation and regexp doesn't match  -----
  after forcing              | "\xE7\n" #<Encoding:ISO-8859-1>
  regexp doesn't match       | nil

-----  Force and then converting makes it human readable, but regex is still confused  -----
  after forcing & converting | "รง\n" #<Encoding:UTF-8>
  regexp still doesn't match | nil

-----  Comparing representations  -----
  original file              | "\xE7\n" [231, 10]       #<Encoding:UTF-8>
  forced encoding            | "\xE7\n" [231, 10]       #<Encoding:ISO-8859-1>
  converted file             | "รง\n"    [195, 167, 10]  #<Encoding:UTF-8>
